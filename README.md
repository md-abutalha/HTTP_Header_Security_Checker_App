# HTTP Header Security Checker

A web-based tool to check if a website has secure HTTP headers implemented correctly. This application helps identify missing or misconfigured security headers that are essential for protecting websites against various attacks.

## Features

- Check for important security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
- Detailed explanations of each security header and its importance
- Recommendations for implementing missing headers
- Security score calculation based on implemented headers
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Security Headers Checked

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Controls resources the browser is allowed to load
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Forces secure (HTTPS) connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking
- **Permissions-Policy**: Controls browser features and APIs
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information sent in the Referer header
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- **Cache-Control**: Directives for caching mechanisms
- **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies**: Specifies if cross-domain policy files are allowed
- **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy**: Controls cross-origin resource embedding
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy**: Controls document opener interactions
- **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy**: Prevents other domains from reading responses

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-header-security-checker.git
   cd http-header-security-checker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Development

To run the application in development mode with auto-restart:

```
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. User inputs a URL in the web interface
2. The backend makes a request to the specified URL to fetch its HTTP headers
3. The application analyzes the headers and checks for the presence of security headers
4. Results are displayed with a security score and recommendations for improvement
